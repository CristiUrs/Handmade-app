                    Odin Leather Goods started off in 2012 on the corner of Odin
                    and Rachelle's dining room table. Back then it was just an
                    experiment to see if Odin could make a simple laptop sleeve.
                    Instead of making just one, he made six or seven - each
                    iteration got better and better. Soon others were asking
                    Odin for other items - custom wallets, belts, and more.

                    We often say "this was a curiosity that turned into a hobby,
                    morphed into a business and developed into a brand."

                    Though our operation is still small and lean, we've been
                    able to continuously produce large volumes of our own
                    branded line of leather goods, as well as manufacture
                    white-labeled and co-branded goods for a growing list of
                    clients and customers. We're definitely on the move. Our
                    product philosophy is to keep things simple.{" "}

                    Our designs allude to a classic American style and focus on
                    functionality. We want our customers to feel confident that
                    OLG's belts, wallets, bags, and pouches are durable enough
                    to travel the world with them, all while still being perfect
                    for everyday use. Not only are our goods made in the USA,
                    (with a few rare occasional exceptions) we also source all
                    of our leather and hardware right here in the USA.

                    In early 2018 we finally outgrew our two car garage workshop
                    and moved into a 1500 sqft workshop space in the heart of
                    Coppell, TX. That new space further expanded our ability to
                    produce some of the best leather goods available on the
                    market. We expanded the brand and opened our retail store in
                    March of the infamous 2020 and will likely move into a
                    larger workshop and open a 2nd retail store in the near
                    future.
